## Duet App (Nov 2016 – Mar 2017) 
Duet App is an artwork that invites participants in India and the UK to build a unique and anonymous relationship with someone on the other side of the world, connecting and exchanging details of their lives by answering one question a day. Prompted by Duet App, a participant gradually builds a picture of their partner and their surroundings through shared messages. 

(The app was planned to be live for an year, it has now been taken down)


## PropCube - Realestate Property Agents Brokers (Mar 2016 – Apr 2016)
PropCube is the most elegant way to showcase the dream of a home to your clients. Whether you want to share information about a property or provide a virtual walkthrough, we have your back. All your property collaterals are now arranged in an elegant and clean layout so that you can act fast and smart. Take advantage of our clean and simple UI and keep your clients updated.

(The business was taken over by another company, so the app has now been taken down)


## Taboo (Dec 2015 – Jan 2016)
Taboo - Word Guessing Party Game is an amazing FREE card game where you make your team guess words without using the 5 taboo words given with each word. It is a fun game to play with your friends and family, anytime, anywhere.
